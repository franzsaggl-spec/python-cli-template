## Team standards

- Keep project-level `CLAUDE.md` strict and actionable.
- Keep workflows agent-first by default (machine-readable outputs where practical).
- Document install/update flow clearly for Linux + Windows.
- Prefer one-liner installers for user onboarding.
- Keep secrets in environment variables only.
